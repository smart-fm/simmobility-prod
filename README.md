SimMoblity is a mobility simulation platform that aims to serve as the nexus of Future Mobility evaluations. It integrate various mobility-sensitive behavioral models with state-of-the-art scalable simulators to predict the impact of mobility demands on transportation networks, intelligent transportation services and vehicular emissions. The platform enables the simulation of the effects of a portfolio of technology, policy and investment options under alternative future scenarios. Specifically, SimMobility encompasses the modeling of millions of agents, from pedestrians to drivers, from phones and traffic lights to GPS, from cars to buses and trains, from second-by-second to year-by-year simulations, across entire countries. It is being devloped by the Future Urban Mobility Research Group at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) and the the Intelligent Transportation System Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
