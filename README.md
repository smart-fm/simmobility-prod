SimMobility is an integrated mobility simulation platform that comprehensively simulates Future Mobility scenarios by integrating long, medium, and short-term travel behavior. Various mobility-sensitive behavioral models are integrated within the state-of-the-art scalable simulators to predict the impact of mobility demands on transportation networks, intelligent transportation services and vehicular emissions. The platform simulates the effects of a portfolio of technology, policy and investment options under alternative future scenarios. SimMobility encompasses the modeling of millions of agents, including pedestrians, drivers, phones, traffic lights, GPS, cars, buses, and trains, from second-by-second to year-by-year simulations and across countries. Its development is ongoing by the Intelligent Transportation System Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART).
